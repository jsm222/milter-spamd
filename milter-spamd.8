.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm milter-spamd
.Nd sendmail milter plugin for SpamAssassin spamd
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl i Ar RE
.Op Fl p Ar pipe
.Op Fl u Ar user
.Op Fl U Ar spamd-user
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
plugin can be used with the milter API of
.Xr sendmail 8
to filter mails based on decisions from SpamAssassin's
.Xr spamd 1
daemon.
Mails are piped to the daemon, which decides whether a mail is
spam or not according to its own configuration.
Spam mails are rejected with an SMTP 554 ("Transaction failed")
reply, containing the score from spamd.
This typically causes the remote MTA to generate a bounce
message to the sender.
Non-spam mails are accepted without any modifications.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-c config"
.It Fl d
Do not detach from controlling terminal.
Produce verbose output on stdout for debugging.
.It Fl i Ar RE
Accept mails without invoking spamd for peers whose host names
or IP addresses match the specified regular expression.
The argument is a case-insensitive extended regular expression
(like an argument of
.Xr egrep 1
-i).
Example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# milter-spamd -i '(^127\\.|^10\\.1\\.|\\.benzedrine\\.cx$)'
.Ed
.Pp
would skip filtering for senders whose host names end
in .benzedrine.cx or whose IP addresses start with 127. or
10.1.
.It Fl p Ar pipe
Use the specified pipe to interface
.Xr sendmail 8 .
Default is unix:/var/spool/milter-spamd/sock.
.It Fl u Ar user
Run as the specified user instead of the default, _milter-spamd.
When
.Nm
is started as root, it calls
.Xr setuid 2
to drop privileges.
The non-privileged user should have read access to the configuration
file and read-write access to the pipe.
.It Fl U Ar spamd-user
Pass the specified user to spamd, so that user's SpamAssassin
settings are used instead of the default system-wide ones.
.El
.Pp
.Sh SENDMAIL CONFIGURATION
The plugin needs to be registered in the
.Xr sendmail 8
configuration, by adding the following lines to the .mc file
.Bd -literal -offset indent
INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`milter-spamd',
	`S=unix:/var/spool/milter-spamd/sock, T=S:30s;R:2m')
.Ed
.Pp
rebuilding /etc/mail/sendmail.cf from the .mc file using
.Xr m4 1 ,
and restarting
.Xr sendmail 8 .
.Pp
.Sh LOGGING
.Nm
sends log messages to
.Xr syslogd 8
using
.Em facility
daemon and, with increasing verbosity,
.Em level
err, notice, info and debug.
The following
.Xr syslog.conf 5
section can be used to log messages to a dedicated file:
.Bd -literal
!milter-spamd
daemon.err;daemon.notice	/var/log/milter-spamd
.Ed
